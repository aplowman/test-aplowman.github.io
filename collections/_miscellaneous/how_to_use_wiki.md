## How the site is organised

## How to add content

### Markdown

The following markdown...

## Adding images

Adding images with Markdown is easy; just type: `![image_description](image_url)`, where `image_description` is a short description of the image, and `image_url` is the URL that points to the image. If you are using Prose.io to add and edit content (i.e. by clicking on the `EDIT` button in the top-right corner of the Wiki), you can easily upload and insert your own images, and Prose.io will insert the correct Markdown code for you.

To use Prose.io to add an image to your Markdown, clik on the `Insert Image` button on the Prose.io toolbar:

![prose_io_toolbar.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/prose_io_toolbar.png)
*Inserting images with Prose.io*

Then you can either manually add the image URL and image description, or you can add an image that has already been added to the Wiki, or you can upload a new image to the wiki. In the latter cases, the image description and image URL are automatically added for you.

![prose_io_insert_image.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/prose_io_insert_image.png)
*Inserting an image with Pose.io.*

```markdown
![Aluminium]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/aluminium.jpg)
```
This is the result of the above markdown:

![Aluminium]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/aluminium.jpg)

### Adding captions to images

Use the following code to add a caption to your image:

```markdown
![Rolling]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/rolling.gif)
*A visualisation of the rolling process.*
```

This is the result of the above markdown:

![Rolling]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/rolling.gif)
*A visualisation of the rolling process.*
