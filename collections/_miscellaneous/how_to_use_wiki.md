## How the site is organised

## How to add content

### Markdown

The following markdown...

## Adding images

Adding images with Markdown is easy; just type: `![image_description](image_url)`, where `image_description` is a short description of the image, and `image_url` is the URL that points to the image. If you are using Prose.io to add and edit content (i.e. by clicking on the `EDIT` button in the top-right corner of the Wiki), you can upload your own images to the Wiki very easily.

```markdown
![Aluminium]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/aluminium.jpg)
```
This is the result of the above markdown:

![Aluminium]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/aluminium.jpg)

### Adding captions to images

Use the following code to add a caption to your image:

```markdown
![Rolling]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/rolling.gif)
*A visualisation of the rolling process.*
```

This is the result of the above markdown:

![Rolling]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/rolling.gif)
*A visualisation of the rolling process.*
